      <h3>What's Robo Brain?</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        Robo Brain is a large-scale
        computational system that learns from publicly available
        Internet resources, computer simulations, and real-life robot trials.
        What will it learn? Lots of stuff - from natural language
        comprehension to object recognition to trajectory planning.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Robo Brain will allow researchers and engineers to
        focus on their area of interest and develop prototypes
        much more quickly. For example, a researcher who develops a novel
        trajectory planning algorithm can experiment using real
        robots by letting Robo Brain take care of object and
        environment recognition. Robo Brain will be the
        J.A.R.V.I.S. to every robot's Iron Man.
