    <h3>So...What's Robo Brain?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      Robo Brain is a large-scale
      computational system that learns from publicly available
      Internet resources, computer simulations, and real-life robot trials.
      It accumulates everything robotics 
      into a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge base.
      Applications include prototyping for robotics research,
      household robots, and Google cars.
