<h2>RoboBrain API Documentation</h2>
<div class="row">
    <p>This document is the full specification of the RoboBrain API. It includes both Client API and the Query API. RoboBrain Client API is developed for pushing information and knowledge into the RoboBrain and Query API is developed for issuing queries to the RoboBrain
For the technical report explaining the technical and algorithmic aspects of the RoboBrain, please refer to: ArXive Link RoboBrain: Large-Scale Knowledge Engine for Robots

<h3>RoboBrain Client API</h3> 
    <div class="row">
        <p>RoboBrain supplies a REST API to its collaborators. 
        Through RoboBrain REST API, collaborators can send their multi-modal information to the brain.</p>

        <p>RoboBrain Client API is a client developed purely in Python 2.X in order to provides unified and easy way to push information to the brain.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>It has multiple processing modes and provide both batch upload and serial upload. Batch upload is implemented in parallel.</li>
            <li>It relies on authentication module of the robobrain.me through HTTP Auth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Installation</h4>

        <p>In order to use the RoboBrain Client API, you need to install a few Python packages.
        Our client requires <code>boto</code> for s3 access, <code>request</code> for sending
        HTTP requests to the REST API and <code>filechunkio</code> for efficient file upload.
        They can be installed by using pip as</p>

        <blockquote>
            <code>sudo pip install boto<br/>
                sudo pip install requests<br/>
        sudo pip install filechunkio</code>
        </blockquote>

        <p>After the required packages are installed, cloning the github repo from <a href="https://github.com/RoboBrainCode/Client">Client API - Github</a> would suffice. For installation problems and requesting an access to the private
        repo, please send an e-mail to the <a href="mailto:robobrain@cs.stanford.edu">robobrain@cs.stanford.edu</a>.

        <h4>Client API Credentials</h4>

        <p>In order to access to the RoboBrain Client API, you need a RoboBrain account.
        For the user account, please use the <a href="http://robobrain.me/#/login">Login link</a>.
        After creating the account, you need to send an e-mail to the <a href="mailto:robobrain@cs.stanford.edu">robobrain@cs.stanford.edu</a>
        explaining your contributor account request. After you request is approved, you will receive an e-mail 
        from us. After that, you can start to use the Client API with your credentials.</p>

        <h4>Information Structure for RoboBrain Interface</h4>

        <p>RoboBrain accepts information in terms of a json structure from its collaborators. Specifically, we use the following structure:</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                        "feedtype": "Type Of The Feed",
                                                                                                                                                                                                        Feedtype is visualized in the bottom left corner of the feed in robobrain.me. It should include a few words and describe the broad category of the feed like Affordance, Grasping, Language etc.

                                                                                                                                                                                                            "text": "Text Caption of the Feed with HashTags",
                                                                                                                                                                                                            Text is the caption of your feed. It should represent the information you are giving in a single English sentence. The keywords in the text which corresponds to abstract or physical entities which are useful to robots should be written as hashtags. Hashtag is written as #keyword. If the hashtag has more than one word, it should be written as #hashtag_with_more_than_one_words. An example is; "The position of a #Standing_human while using a #shoe is distributed as #$heatmap_12."

                                                                                                                                                                                                            If you want to hashtag a media use #$ instead of #. For example, "#cup has an apperance in #image" is refering to the media not the concept "image"; hence, it should be replaced as "#cup has an apperance in #$image"

                                                                                                                                                                                                                "source_text": "Your Project Name",

It is both used for visualization and verification if necessary.

These files can be images, videos, parameters, point clouds etc. RoboBrain requires large amount of data so we suggest pushing as many media as possible. However, visualizing that many media is not preferred on robobrain.me web page. So, we requests the feed provider to choose a few media to be displayed on the robobrain.me and mark them as "True" in the "mediashow". The number of members of the "mediashow" should be equal to the number of media file you push. Indeed, order represent the matching between files and these attributes.

Try to use the available edges/predicates. However, if you need a different edge/predicate type, you can simply include it in your feed. We will automatically add it to the list. However, to make the machine learning algorithm slightly simpler, try to be consistent with the previously used edges.

Please read the formatting instructions in Information Structure before implementing your code. Please also note that, there is still no request is made to the RoboBrain and all information are stored in the memory. If you are pushing large amount of information, this approach can cause a problem. Hence, if you are pushing a large amount of information, please call the rC.push2Brain() function before you reach the memory limit of your system.

You can use either batchUpload.py or batchUploadforBigDataset.py. Depending on the size of the information you are pushing. If the amount of information you are pushing (excluding media files) is small enough to fit in the memory, use the batchUpload.py since it is faster. However, if your data is too big (e.g. at the scale of WordNet, ImageNet, Freebase, RoboBrain etc.), use the batchUploadforBigDataset.py. It is slower but more reliable.
